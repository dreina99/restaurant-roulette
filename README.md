# Description: This is a collaborative project which displays a random restaurant in the area
# when you enter a food category, price level, and a zip code/city name. My contribution included
# the zip code and city functionality, which included using geocoding along with the Google Places API. 
# I also worked on the map which dynamically recenters based on the restaurant location. Finally, I implemented
# the back button which allows the user to loop back through past restaurants that were saved in 
# local storage.
